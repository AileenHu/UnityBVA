- ADB Chain Runtime Controller is used to create an independent physical core under runtime, identify the components that generate physical data and process it, and provide a series of physical control parameters. 
- Each ADB Chain Runtime Controller creates a local area of the physical core, which can be stopped or started at any time.
- The ADB Chain Runtime Controller will search for all the physical bones of the current gameobjet and its children, and pass it into the physical kernel.
- ADB Chain Runtime Controller will detect all potential collision bodies every frame and pass them into the physics kernel.
- Due to issues such as jobs security checks.Please do not use DestoryImmediately for ADB Chain Runtime Controller.
